## :question: *About the project:*
### *In this project we've created a system which simulates shipment services. This system keeps track of packages shipped from around the world, from the moment they departure until they arrive to the logistic center of the shipment company.*


*__SHIPMENT SIMULATOR:__  Will simulate scanning of packages before they're sent, and will notify their departure via message. When a package is sent, it will be stored in the Redis database service as cache. To simulate arrival of the package, the Shipment Simulator will generate a QRCode for each package received, which consists of all the package's information and store it in Firebase cloud storage.*

*__HOT-LINE:__  Will display the data from Redis' cache in the Dashboard for every package which is departed to it's destination and update that data in Real-time. The Dashboard also includes statistics such as number of packages per country district, charts and graphs of packages' size distribution per district and type of tax billing distribution per district.*

*__COLD-LINE:__  The packages' information will also be stored in MongoDB database service as history of all shipments. We'll use the data from MongoDB to generate a unique CSV file which holds only the information about the packages' items, the CSV file will be exported to BigML service in order to generate an Associations Model based on Apriori algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases, this model will get us prediction of support and confidence for every item.*
